# AnalystLLM
The Snowflake BUILD Bootcamp Day One Project
I built an Analyst App that uses a Snowflake database, Snowflake Cortex, and Streamlit to answer analytics sales questions from company documents without hallucination.

It's based off this [Quickstart](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_cortex_analyst/index.html?index=../..index#0)

## Built Database Structure with SQL Worksheet Prompts
Used SQL prompt to build the warehouse, database, schema, and tables.
Used additional lines of the prompt to pull data from documents into the tables.
